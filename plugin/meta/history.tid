* ''1.1.0'' -- `susearch` now supports `strict` flag which requires all words to match to include in the output.
* ''1.0.2'' -- `susearch`, `susearch-sort` and `susearch-mark` no longer ignore spaces when matching words (ie. `sand` no longer matches `s and`).
* ''1.0.1'' -- `focus-on` fixed a bug where last character would not be displayed if the whole text was supposed to be visible
* ''1.0.0'' -- Initial release
